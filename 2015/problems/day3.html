Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---</h2><p>Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.</p>
<p>He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next.  Moves are always exactly one house to the north (<code>^</code>), south (<code>v</code>), east (<code>&gt;</code>), or west (<code>&lt;</code>).  After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.</p>
<p>However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once.  How many houses receive <em>at least one present</em>?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&gt;</code> delivers presents to <code>2</code> houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.</li>
<li><code>^&gt;v&lt;</code> delivers presents to <code>4</code> houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.</li>
<li><code>^v^v^v^v^v</code> delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only <code>2</code> houses.</li>
</ul>
