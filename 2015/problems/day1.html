Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---</h2><p>Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out!  To save Christmas, he needs you to collect <em class="star">fifty stars</em> by December 25th.</p>
<p>Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. <span title="Also, some puzzles contain Easter eggs like this one. Yes, I know it's not traditional to do advent calendars for Easter.">Good luck!</span></p>
<p>Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.</p>
<p>Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor <code>0</code>) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.</p>
<p>An opening parenthesis, <code>(</code>, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, <code>)</code>, means he should go down one floor.</p>
<p>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(())</code> and <code>()()</code> both result in floor <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>(((</code> and <code>(()(()(</code> both result in floor <code>3</code>.</li>
<li><code>))(((((</code> also results in floor <code>3</code>.</li>
<li><code>())</code> and <code>))(</code> both result in floor <code>-1</code> (the first basement level).</li>
<li><code>)))</code> and <code>)())())</code> both result in floor <code>-3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To <em>what floor</em> do the instructions take Santa?</p>
